# NavigationalTool
An app to help navigate around difficult building layouts.

## Requirements
#### Top priority (ie: "Must")
- Work on Android.
- Be able to switch out the building layout easily.
- Find shortest route to destination.
- Show this route on a top down floor plan.

#### Mid priority (ie: "Should")
- Have different access levels for different routes.
- Cointain disabled friendly routes.
- Show 360* pictures outside each major location or junction.
- Be properly documented with more than just descriptive method & variable names.
- Clean up the floor plan & make the UI look good.

#### Low priority (ie: "Would be good to")
- Figure out where you are automatically.
- Group rooms together. (eg: "Lectures halls", "Offices", etc)
- Show alternative routes.
- Work on iOS. (very very low priority)

## Notes
We're using the layout of the Physics Building whilst making the app, not the Fry Building.

I think we agreed we'd be using Eclipse, though this shouldn't really matter as long as the .gitignore includes everything it needs to.

We should agree to use the same Java version. Java 8 would probably be best, as we used that for OOP last year and it's the most stable currently, even though Java 10/11 should be okay.

We should try to avoid any ideas that have phones talking to each other, as that'd require a server somewhere which would not be ideal.

It'd be good to try and meet up in person for more than just the mentor and client meetings, just to make sure we're communicating properly and all up to speed on all decisions/issues that we have. Either Wednesday, the weekend, or some time after a shared lecture is probably best for this.
